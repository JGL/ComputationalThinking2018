					<h3>1. Seymour Papert and Alan Kay.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert">Seymour Papert</a> was interested in learning theories - especially in how computers could make a difference in how children learn. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> was the first computer language that I encountered as a child - all based around drawing with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot)">Turtle</a>.</li>
						<li>Papert pioneered the idea of Microworlds - places where you could safely experiment to think about how to change the future, rather than train children for the jobs of today.</li>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a> was inspired by Papert and others and went on to pioneer thinking around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Orientated programming</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(computing)">Overlapping Window Graphical User Interfaces</a> both at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox Parc</a>.</li>
						<li>Two great talks by Kay: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmTSpJU-Xc">Normal Considered Harmful</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1R2jH4PQEo">Education That Takes Us To The 22nd Century</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>2. Conway's Game of Life, Cellular Automata and rules 30 and 110.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> was invented by John Conway in 1970. Conway created it to simulate simple biological life with four rules.</li>
						<li>It turns out you can even make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8">Game of Life inside of Game of Life</a>.</li>
						<li>There was an existing field called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular Automata</a> which began in the 1940's.</li>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a> did further work on CA's in the 1980's discovering several interesting systems - including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30">Rule 30</a> (which is unpredictable) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110">Rule 110</a> (which has been proven to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing complete</a>).</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>3. Boids, Evolved Virtual Creatures and emergence.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Boids</a> was an artifical life system developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986. It simulated realistic flocking with just three simple rules. Compare the simulation to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eakKfY5aHmY">murmuration</a>.</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBgG_VSP7f8">Evolved Virtual Creatures</a> was a film created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Sims">Karl Sims</a> in 1994 that showed how virtual creatures could evolve the ability to walk.</li>
						<li>Both are examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a> - or the idea that "the whole is greater than the sum of the parts".</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>4. Joscha Bach and a Computational Universe.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://bach.ai/">Joscha Bach</a> is a researcher in Cognitive Science & Artificial Intelligence.</li>
						<li>He's done a <a href="http://bach.ai/videos/">series of talks</a> at the annual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress">Chaos Communication Congress</a>.</li>
						<li>My favourite talk of his is titled <a href="http://bach.ai/machine-dreams/">"Machine Dreams - Dreaming Machines"</a> is concerned with the idea that the basis of the entire universe is computational. His talk discusses a computational approach to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/">Epistemology</a> (what the fuck?), <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysics/"></a>Metaphysics (why the fuck?) and finally <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ontology/">Ontology</a> (the fuck?).</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>5. Pace layering, Pattern Language and the purpose of Art</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-brand">Pace layering</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand">Stewart Brand</a>'s six layered framework for how a healthy society works.</li>
						<li>Pace layering grew out of Brand's thinking that he developed for his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Buildings_Learn">"How Buildings Learn"</a>.</li>
						<li>This grew out of Frank Duffy's work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearing_layers">Shearing Layers</a>.</li>
						<li>Christopher Alexander's book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language">"A Pattern Language"</a> which proposed ways of thinking in a variety of fields, as a way of helping people solve very large complex problems.</li>
						<li>Brand argues that it is Art's responsibility to experiment in all areas, in order to test the future and create ways of thinking about new problems or opportunities.</li>
